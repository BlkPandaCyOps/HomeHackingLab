## VirtualBox Adventures

I've set up VirtualBox as my digital playground where I conduct various cybersecurity experiments.

## Kali Linux Dive

Installed Kali Linux in VirtualBox and exploring its powerful tools for cybersecurity.

## PimpMyKali Fun

Customizing Kali Linux using PimpMyKali to enhance functionality and appearance.

## Metasploitable Shenanigans

My current project involves Metasploitable 2. I've set it up and am attempting to exploit vulnerabilities through different ports, such as FTP (Port 21), SSH (Port 22), Telnet (Port 23), and more.

## To-Do List

### Vulnhub Exploration

- Set up additional Vulnhub machines for diverse challenges.
- Tackle new scenarios to enhance problem-solving skills.

### Networking Quests

- Explore more network services beyond current targets.
- Experiment with advanced penetration testing scenarios.
